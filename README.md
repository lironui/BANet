#  Bilateral Awareness Network

In this repository, we implement the Bilateral Awareness Network which contains a dependency path and a texture path to fully capture the long-range relationships and fine-grained details in very fine resolution (VFR) urban scene images . 

The detailed results can be seen in the [Transformer Meets Convolution: A Bilateral Awareness Network for Semantic Segmentation of Very Fine Resolution Urban Scene Images](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2106/2106.12413.pdf).

* [MAResU-Net](https://github.com/lironui/MAResU-Net)->A ResNet-based network with attention mechanism.
* [Multi-Attention-Network](https://github.com/lironui/Multi-Attention-Network)->A network with multi kernel attention mechanism.
